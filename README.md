# local-env
Currently, you have to be within the project and execute the scripts. If you guys would like for these scripts to be accessed globally, just let me know. I can also update the names accordingly, if it feels like too much to type.

### Starting up your environment
```
./local-up
```

### Shutting containers down
```
./local-down
```

### Following logs on a container
```
./local-logs | grep <name of container>
```
